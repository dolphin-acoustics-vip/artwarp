function X = warp(u1, u2);

% From ARTwarp_Activate_Categories call of 'warp' function, u1 = the reference contour
% ('weight(i,j)') and u2 = the active contour that's being compared ('input' or
% 'DATA(c1).contour')

% This algorithm determines a warping function to minimize the sum square difference of two frequency contours. 
% The algorithm is similar to that of Itakura (1975). The maximum number of consecutive horizontal steps (2 in 
% Itakura 1975) is 3 in this version (determined by x the statement 'if k(i-1,j)+1 >= x'). The function also allows 
% vertical jumps of 3 rather than 2.The function yields an array that contains the sum square difference of the 
% original and the warped contour in cell {1,1}, as well as the warping function in cell {1,2}

%TEST FOR DIFFERENCES IN LENGTH GREATER THAN THREE
m = length(u1); %the number of data points in the reference contour
n = length(u2); %the number of data points in the comparison contour
if max([m n])/(min([m n])-1) >= 3
    %disp('The length of the two contours differs by more than a factor of 3');
    X = {0, []}; return;
