# ARTwarp 

ARTwarp is a MATLAB-based programme for the automated categorisation of tonal
animal sounds. It has been tested successfully [3] for bottlenose dolphin whistles
and killer whale calls, but will be applicable to any sound that can be
described by frequency contours.

The categorisation algorithm combines dynamic time-warping [1] to measure contour 
similarity with an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) neural network to group sounds 
into different categories. The programme provides categorisation details, as well 
as a reference contour representing the typical frequency shape of each category.

The code has been run successfully using Matlab 2016a and 2016b.

- `ARTwarp_csv.m` provides the option to open `.ctr` (Beluga) and `.csv` files

- `ARTwarp_txt.m` provides the option to open `.ctr` (Beluga), `.csv`, and also `.txt` files

This version of `ARTwarp_txt` displays the iteration number and number of whistles 
analysed in the command window while ARTwarp is running. It saves the results at 
the end of each iteration.
