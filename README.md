# ARTwarp 

## Old Classes
Michael's version of ARTwarp is stored in `Old Classes` directory
`RunARTwarp` runs the classes that hae been created so far.
`Load_Data` lets users select the files they want to analyse and uses `Load_Datatypes` to put the data into a format ARTwarp can use.
`plot_net.m` plots the categories and its contours overlayed together in a tile layout
