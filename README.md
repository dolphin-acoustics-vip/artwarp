# ARTwarp 

ARTwarp is a MATLAB-based programme for the automated categorisation of tonal
animal sounds. It has been tested successfully for bottlenose dolphin whistles
and killer whale calls, but will be applicable to any sound that can be
described by frequency contours.

These `ARTwarp.m` files have been run successfully using Matlab 2016a and 2016b

`ARTwarp.m` will open whistle contours extracted using Beluga

`ARTwarp_txt.m` provides the option to open `.ctr` (Beluga), `.csv`, or `.txt` files

This version of `ARTwarp_txt` displays the iteration number and number of whistles 
analysed in the command window while ARTwarp is running. It saves the results at 
the end of each iteration.
